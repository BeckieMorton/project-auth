# Project Auth API


## The problem

<ins>Describe how you approached to problem</ins>: I first tackled the backend and wrote simple endpoints with everything in the Server.js file, I then refactored my structure and followed Diego's examples, trying to follow each line of code, there are several things I am still confused about! I had issues with the Bcrypt when deploying the backend and realised i was using bcrypt-nodejs. 

I had issues connecting my db to my frontend at local host to help debug it. Help from my team was much appreciated! I was confused following Diego's example using Zustand so created a much simpler version, keeping the fetch function inside the register component.

I have one home page that displays both login and register options which then use React-Router to navigate and tenary oporators to display more information on the same page if the registration or login was successful.

<ins>How did you plan?</ins>: Completing the course content, I completed the code alongs and was able to get this simple structure to work. I started with this, everything in the server.js file and then slowly followed Diego's code example to re:structure into models, middleware, controllers, and routes. For the frontend I used React Router and useNavigate for navigation. I deployed both frontend and backend early on in the project.

<ins>What tools and techniques you used to solve it</ins>: Express API, MongoDB, Mongoose, jsonwebtoken, express-asyn-handler, bcrypt, dotenv  ...and for my frontend: HTML+CSS, React, JS, React Router, useNavigation

<ins>What technologies did you use?</ins>: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Router, React hooks (useState, useParams, useEffect)

<ins>If you had more time, what would be next?</ins>: I want to get my frontend and backend working together! So I need to spend time working out how to do this.
